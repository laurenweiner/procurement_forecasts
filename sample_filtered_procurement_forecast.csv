The prototype model works by structuring all DHS MAOL 1&2 level acquisition work into a task list / WBS of fewer than 60 major acquisition tasks, identifying which programs completed which tasks in the base year of 2020 and plan to complete in the next year of 2021, estimating the ratio of FTE from the annual staffing plan allocated to each worked task, and ultimately crafting a model that shows how programs are over / understaffed.  The prototype will be iteratively improved through continued feedback with component stakeholders, and updates regularly published to the DHS Mobius hosting site.  Once completed, the model will allow improved predictive analytics related to the ideal number and type of FTE needed to successfully deploy major programs at DHS.",541990,$1M to $2M,Grant Thorton,TBD,03/14/2022,DWAC,F2022057390

The letter proposed developing new GPS spectrum radio frequency interference (RFI) criteria to inform future proposals for non-space, commercial uses in the bands adjacent to the GPS signals. Adherence to these criteria would ensure that any such future proposals could be implemented without compromising existing and evolving uses of space-based PNT services vital to economic, public safety, scientific and national security needs.The Department of Transportation’s (DOT) approach to accomplish this task is to develop GPS adjacent-band transmitter power limit criteria. These criteria could then be used to define new adjacent-band applications that would be compatible with GPS and could form the basis for GPS spectrum interference criteria. The FAA and OST-R developed a GPS Adjacent Band Compatibility Assessment Plan  to provide the framework for definition of the processes and assumptions that will form the basis for development of the GPS adjacent-band compatibility criteria for GPS civil applications.  To determine the adjacent band criteria, there exist two requirements:1. Provide a GPS receiver test plan that incorporates frequency interference from LTE cellular, CW, and OOBE interference sources.2. Measure where GPS receivers are susceptible to loss to received GPS signals (tolerance mask). Measured masks should include interference from LTE cellular, CW, and OOBE interference sources  A list of GPS receivers, to be tested, shall be provided by the government and industry through government sponsored workshops.  The government does not intend to provide any GPS receivers for testing and requires the contractor to obtain GPS receivers through loan, lease, purchase and/or use of existing contractor equipment. The recommended contractor currently has a contract with the FAA to conduct related work involving certified GPS receivers used in aviation applications.  In contrast, the work outlined above, involves other civil GPS applications.  The current work being performed for aviation applications was awarded on a non-competitive basis as the contractor is a federally funded research and development center (FFRDC) for the FAA.",,"Darren Shaffer",darren.shaffer@dot.gov,"(617) 494-2332",No,No,

According to Amtrak, 2,200 trains carry some 250,000 passengers along some portion of the Northeast Corridor daily. Amtrak service accounts for more than half the traffic (compared with commercial aviation) between New York and Washington. FY 2010 travel totaled 10.4 million passengers. The share of intercity travel accounted for by private automobiles is unknown. In addition to providing mobility for urban and intercity travelers, the Corridor improves the reliability of travel by providing alternatives when, for example, air travel is impeded by weather events. Like other transportation systems, the NEC will be subject to the impacts of a changing climate. Climate impacts may include: rail buckling from additional heat; operational impacts from more frequent storms, flooding of substations, tunnels, track, and bridges exacerbated by sea level rise, flood damage from more intense storm events, heat effects on overhead catenaries, heat and weather effects on waiting passengers. These climate impacts will affect the capacity and reliability of both commuter and intercity travel along the corridor as well as freight movement. The purpose of this study is to examine the potential impact of climate change on the NEC (on the railroad tracks owned or used by AMTRAK running between Washington, DC and Boston) and its effect on rail operations based on existing and future traffic conditions.","Approximately $250K total.

To accomplish this, the INVEST criteria are divided into four modules: System Planning for States (SPS), System Planning for Regions (SPR), Project Development (PD), and Operations and Maintenance (OM). The SPS, SPR, and OM modules are intended for evaluating an agency’s programs and the PD module is for the evaluation of projects, from early project planning through construction. Each module is independent and is evaluated separately. The PD module consists of multiple scorecards designed to recognize the varying scope, scale, and context of projects across the country. Since the launch of version 1.0, FHWA has released multiple updates of INVEST (versions 1.1 and 1.2) to address user feedback and reflect changes in sustainability standards of practice. INVEST is currently hosted at https://www.sustainablehighways.org/. The Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe Center) currently provides program support, technical assistance, and strategic outreach and communications to FHWA’s Office of Natural Environment (HEPN) to ensure the timely and effective delivery of activities related to INVEST, including maintenance and user support of the INVEST website. As sustainability best practices in transportation systems, projects, and programs continue to evolve and change, so must INVEST change to recognize, incorporate, and promote these practices along with the integrating the latest guidance and innovative research within the field of transportation.

Planning in jurisdictional silos can interfere with essential coordination of regional transportation planning solutions, which can lead to project delays, process inconsistencies, and reduced freight reliability.  An enhanced process for effective communication across traditional boundaries used by State DOTs, RPAs, and transit authorities can result in expedited project delivery, improved collaboration, policy implementation, technology use and performance management. Beginning in 2016, and building upon the Federal Highway Administration’s (FHWA) Regional Models of Cooperation initiative, the FHWA Office of Planning, Environment, and Realty (HEP) hosted a series of megaregional workshops throughout the nation. The primary goals of the workshops were to provide a forum for regional partners to share common interests and projects of mutual concern, important emerging challenges, trends, and opportunities to enhance partnerships across jurisdictional boundaries.  In addition, the workshops were intended to facilitate the creation of an ongoing framework that provides the various megaregions a model and communication channel to continue the megaregion concept after the workshops’ conclusion.  The funds dedicated for this research will assist in the development of a framework for regional collaboration and coordination, an analysis of the current state of the practice of megaregional planning, identification of best practices, and “next-steps” guidance beyond the Megaregional Workshops this is necessary for advancement of the concept.  To date, such resources have not yet been fully developed for national integration.",,"scott allen",scott.allen@dot.gov,"(202) 366-2650",No,No,

While most State Departments of Transportation (DOTs) and large Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) serving Transportation Management Areas have explored and implemented Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) and other innovative/alternative finance opportunities to supplement revenue generation, most smaller MPOs and Regional Planning Agencies (RPAs) serving rural areas lack the capacity, legal authority, or resources necessary to leverage these financial tools.  HEPP-20 provides capacity building, including research, training, education, and dissemination of information through workshops, conferences, webinars, publications, and other resources to promote economic development considerations into transportation planning and programming.  HEPP-20 plans to partner with the newly created Build America Bureau to examine the current state of the practice innovative finance-use at state DOTs, small MPOs and RPAs serving rural areas. The focus of the research is directed on how innovative finance strategies are included in Long Range Transportation Plans at state, regional, and local levels, identify challenges and opportunities, identify best practice examples, and develop a scalable P3 development process guide so that P3s can be a viable option for all states and communities regardless of size.",,"scott allen",scott.allen@dot.gov,"(202) 366-2650",No,No,

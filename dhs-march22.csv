TSA employs over 50,000 employees and maintains approximately 40,000 IT assets which results in a consistently high number of cases that need review.  This high volume of cases, in addition to the exponentially large number of unknown files associated with each case, requires a large amount of time and manpower to analyze and validate each file.  TSA needs a solution that automates the investigators ability to query unknown files for potential malicious content.  This solution will enable existing security toolsets utilized by TSA to integrate into an online database of malware and conduct automated searches, freeing more time for the investigator to focus on an investigation.  This will also allow the Computer Network Defense Branch to proactively monitor for malware alerts triggered by the integrated security toolsets.
 
 TSA requires the following three items for subscription-based access in support of malicious files and URL investigation and threat hunting:  
 
 1)	Virus Total Enterprise Subscription and API licenses supporting:
         a.	3,000 lookup requests per minute,
         b.	30,000 requests per day, and
         c.	Minimum monthly quota of 1,000,000,000 requests;
 2)	Virus Total Intelligence subscription supporting 15,000 searches and downloads per month; and 
 3)	Virus Total platform and technical support.

 The installation shall include completing all low voltage wiring, device installation, system programming, and system testing involving four (4) separate security systems that encompass the ESS:
 
 -	Access Control System (ACS)
 -	Intrusion Detection System (IDS)
 -	Video Management System (VMS)
 -	Audio Monitoring System (AMS)
 
 The contractor must be able to plan for and acquire all necessary components for each system to complete a turnkey installation while keeping pace with the overall construction schedule for the new office space and gym. This is an active construction project, so the contractor must be able to start work upon award of the contract.
 
 The project requires a contractor who is a certified installer and has at least five (5) years of experience installing the following commercial systems:
 
 - Hirsch/Identiv FICAM ACS
 - Bosch G Series IDS
 - Axis Communications Internet Protocol VMS
 
 Each system (except for the AMS) will require at least thirty (30) end of line components with the IDS involving more than sixty (60) devices. The contractor must be able to complete all work to fully install these devices within a four (4) week time period in early 2022. The project also involves the installation of all network and workstation hardware, to include the furnishing of a rack with appropriate back-up power supply inside a computer equipment room.
 
 The project requires experience integrating fiber-optic cable with a CAT6 network.
 
 The project will require a substantial number of written deliverables to include equipment lists, comprehensive plans for installation and testing, a quality control plan, as-built drawings, cable management plans, and network topologies. To accomplish this and the entire ESS installation, the government will require the contractor to employ the following key personnel:
 
 -	Project Manager  
 -	Systems Security Engineer
 -	Lead Installer
 
 Once delivery is accepted by the government, there is a requirement for the contractor to provide a one (1) year warranty period on all systems.
 
 The only potential cost effectiveness issues are related to equipment lead times due to chip shortages.  Currently the lead time is approximately 8 weeks for delivery and the prices may be higher if the vendor is able to provide items sooner.
 
 This requirement is a component of an overall buildout of the Green FOB and to ensure that the overall project milestones remain on track, this contact must be awarded no later than December 1, 2021. This award timeframe will ensure that the vendor is able to meet the long lead times for the equipment and have it delivered in time to begin the work.","Q3 2022","05/25/2022","03/25/2022",""

The ICE FMU manages the complete lifecycle of a fleet of 13,319 vehicles. Currently, the ICE fleet is composed of 75% ICE owned passenger vehicles assets and 25% GSA leased passenger vehicle assets. Most ICE’s fleet assets directly support a law enforcement mission and are lifecycle managed as law enforcement fleet assets.
 
 ICE FMU administers fleet management systems, data analysis, and policies and procedures for the complete life cycle of all fleet vehicles; and exercises compliance oversight for all ICE fleet, including audits and evaluations. The FMU also is responsible for the development, implementation, and O&M of the Fleet Management Information System (FMIS) called “Fleet H.O.M.E”, which was procured in 2021 to comply with FMR 102-34, Motor Vehicle Management, Subpart J and centralize fleet management activities.  Fleet H.O.M.E is currently being configured for base testing and is intended to modernize and automate fleet management from its current management by siloed legacy systems and disconnected Microsoft Office applications. 
 
 Fleet H.O.M.E is built on the commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) product Chevin FleetWave. The ICE Fleet Management workflows have been configured into a custom FleetWave instance hosted in an AWS GovCloud environment. Fleet H.O.M.E. is an accredited DHS information system and is subject to the policies and procedures outlined in the DHS 4300A handbook. 
 
 The FMU has made significant strides in creating a DHS leading fleet management program and strives to continue to improve mission effectiveness. Successful Fleet H.O.M.E. implementation and O&M are critical to ICE becoming a leading DHS component and federal fleet management program. Milestones to date include the development of standardized processes, training of fleet personnel across the country and overseas, stringent internal controls, and improvements to planning, decision making, and responsiveness through data analysis and process automation activities.  Even with these successes, FMU recognizes that it needs to continue to evolve its operations to become more agile and responsive while reducing overall costs. Building upon the strong foundation of fleet management that has been established, FMU should continue to advance its mission support services to ICE Program areas while improving analytical and technical capabilities that will help to identify significant cost savings both in their own operations as well as for ICE.","Q3 2022","02/25/2022","12/16/2021",""

 The Department of Homeland Security Science and Technology Directorate (DHS S&T) Office of National Laboratories (ONL) is seeking proposals for Scientific, Technical and Engineering Support for PIADC Decontamination and Closure of the major facility buildings (Buildings 257, 102 and 101) and exterior areas (as needed) at the Plum Island Animal Disease Center (PIADC). The Plum Island Closure and Support (PICS) program requires senior and technical level expertise to perform decontamination validation testing, provide third-party verification testing, collaborate in planning/executing applied scientific activities for decontamination method assessment and development, and deliver engineering and logistics to implement methods.
 
 Measures to facilitate and ensure an approved end-state for the various PIADC structures utilized for execution of, and support for scientific activities will entail various mechanisms of sampling, disinfection and decontamination. These activities will occur as part of a coordinated plan for facility closure and will entail simultaneous activities at multiple sites on the facility grounds. Consequently, the Plum Island Closure and Support (PICS) program requires senior and technical level support to provide biological decontamination and decommissioning support services including, but not limited to: planning/executing scientific activities for decontamination method development and testing and evaluation (T&E) to include analyses involving various technologies, sampling approaches, monitoring methods, among others; translating results of method development and T&E into plans for terminal facility decontamination; delivery of engineering planning, engineering design, and logistics to support implementation of facility decontamination methods and/or independent third-party review of such developed products; integration of scientific, engineering and other technical data in order to produce a comprehensive facility decontamination plan; operation of an on-island mobile laboratory for provision of independent third-party verification/validation testing of biological and chemical indicators (Self-Contained Biological Indicators [SCBIs], spore strips, integrators); and development of documentation of verification/validation results for review by regulatory bodies.
 
 Each activity will be accomplished while working collaboratively with additional PICS federal and contracted personnel, both onsite and offsite. In addition, it should be noted that the subject activities of this RFP do not entail the performance of the primary operations and maintenance functions or physical execution of decontamination activities for the biocontainment buildings at Plum Island.","Q3 2022","03/25/2022","12/28/2021",""

Examples of contractor tasks include providing 168 hours a week COP Manager support, scheduling, technical support, documentation management, just-in time training, database support, briefing support and other tasks directly associated with supporting a COP for the USCG. Program Description Operational Commanders are required to have a robust command and control system which will provide them with the capability to produce and/or contribute to, evaluate, display, and disseminate the USCG's Common Operating Picture (COP); a near-real-time depiction of the tactical situation. The COP will enable Maritime Domain Awareness and act as a decision-making tool for the Area, District, and Sector Commanders by allowing the exchange and display of mission essential data, including asset, threat, and high interest vessel information as well as other data elements, including geographical overlays. To achieve this goal, the USCG Office of Command, Control, Communications, Computers (C4) and Sensor Capabilities (CG-761) has designated the Global Command and Control System - Joint GCCS-J to serve as the command and control system and to act as the foundation for the ashore command and control (C2) architecture. The Global Command and Control System (GCCS) has been deployed to all Area, District, and Sector command centers and is the primary tool in developing the COP. It integrates disparate data source and fuses it with information gained through local and national sensors to produce a near-real-time depiction of the overall operational picture within a specified geographic region. The USCG's ashore command and control information exchange is based on a Common Operational Picture Synchronization Tools (CST) environment. USCG TOPCOP located at Atlantic Area (LANTAREA) Command Center is the primary data exchange point for Department of Defense (DOD) partners. The TOPCOP is designated as the controlling node for the Coast Guard COP. All District level command centers are equipped with GCCS and contribute site-specific information to the COP as well as assist the TOPCOP in the correlation and fusion of data as required for developing a complete operational picture.","Q2 2022","03/11/2022","02/24/2022",""

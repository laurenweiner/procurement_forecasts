USAID has identified the EVAL-ME II IDIQ contract instrument to issue a Request for Task Order Proposals for direct technical assistance required for Mission support, and is developing a Leader with Associate Awards agreement for the capacity-building and grant making required to local organizations (See AA-319549). The proposed acquisition mechanism will help missions and DC-based operating units to better engage and support marginalized and vulnerable groups (i.e., children in adversity, ethnic/religious minorities, Indigenous Peoples, LGBTI people, persons with disabilities, victims of torture and youth) in the development of their communities and countries. Operating Units will be able to access two categories of activities 1) learning and adaptation, 2) direct support for specific groups and topics (i.e., through organizational capacity building, small grants, and rapid response).

These mechanisms will address gaps missions have in assessing the needs of, engaging with, and supporting the priorities of marginalized and vulnerable groups around the world. As such, the proposed assistance mechanism is flexible, allows for rapid access for different operating units, and harnesses specialized technical knowledge to build the capacity and effectiveness of specialized groups working to advance USAID’s inclusive development objectives.

Theory of Change/Development Hypothesis: 
IF missions had access to and could buy into a mechanism designed to address their inclusive development analytical and programmatic needs, THEN they would be better positioned to turn their commitments to inclusive development into action.
